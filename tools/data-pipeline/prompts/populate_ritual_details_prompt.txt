## 🌿 What a Ritual Is
A ritual is a short, intentional practice designed to help people slow down, notice, and emotionally reconnect — with themselves or a partner.  
Each ritual creates a *felt shift*: from tension to calm, distance to closeness, numbness to warmth.  
Rituals are simple, emotionally grounded, and meant to be used in daily life — not poetic or abstract.  
Tone should feel like gentle guidance from a trusted friend: **warm, invitational, but also clear and structured**.
